# EDR-Telemetry Project Requirements
# This file lists all Python dependencies needed for the EDR-Telemetry project

# Core table formatting library used across multiple scripts
prettytable>=3.0.0

# Data manipulation and analysis (used in convert.py)
pandas>=1.5.0

# HTTP requests library (used in fetch_contributors.py)
requests>=2.28.0

# Linux-specific dependencies for telemetry generation
# D-Bus Python bindings for system service management (Linux telemetry generator)
dbus-python>=1.2.18

# User account management library for Linux (Linux telemetry generator)
# NOTE: libuser is NOT available via pip and must be installed as a system package:
# On Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-libuser libuser
# On RHEL/CentOS/Fedora: sudo yum install python3-libuser libuser
# The Python bindings (python3-libuser) are installed system-wide and will be
# available to your virtual environment after system installation.

# Additional system dependencies notes:
# The Linux telemetry generator also requires:
# - gcc compiler for kernel module compilation
# - kernel headers for driver loading functionality
# - sudo privileges for certain system-level operations
# - systemd for service management operations

# Development dependencies (optional)
# Add these if you need development/testing tools:
# pytest>=7.0.0
# black>=22.0.0
# flake8>=5.0.0
